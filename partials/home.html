    <p>One of the fundamental principles of finance is the concept that $1 today is more valuable than $1 a year from now. The reason for this is two-fold. First, due to the destructive force of inflation, a dollar likely will not go as far in the future. Second, if I have the dollar in my hand today, I can invest it and earn a return in the form of dividends, interest or capital gains. The best money advice anyone can ever give you is to firmly establish this time value of money concept in your head. The key to financial prosperity is realizing the potential value of every dollar that comes into your hands. In fact, I think of cash as a seed â€“ you can either eat it (spend it) or invest it (sow it). Source: https://www.thebalance.com/you-re-spending-your-millions-1-at-a-time-356374</p>

    <h2>GMO Food</h2>
    <p>Genetically modified organisms are great. That's not necessarily a popular opinion, but it's true. GM apples and potatoes were recently approved in the US and Canada, but with some pushback from companies due to consumer demand. A very large percentage of the population is either skeptical or outright afraid of GM food. There are some legitimate concerns around the business/legal realm of GM crops, but in terms of human safety and nutrition, the consensus is in and GM crops are safe. Obviously each new crop that is developed needs to be tested and properly regulated. However, any concerns about the actual methods of genetic modification are highly unwarranted. Any plant or animal product is full of DNA that our body readily digests, messing with one or two genes isn't going to impact human health. The only way GM food could affect human health is if the modification somehow produce a protein product that was actively toxic to humans. Say what you want about corporate greed, but a big biotech company would never do that because that would cost them a lot of money in the lawsuits down the road.

    <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>
    <p>The world is expected to add another billion people within the next 15 years, bringing the total global population from 7.3 billion in mid-2015 to 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion by 2100, according to new estimates from the UN. Currently, 60 percent of the global population lives in Asia, 16 percent in Africa, 10 percent in Europe, 9 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and only 5 percent in North America and Oceania. China and India are the largest countries in the world, together making up almost 40 percent of the world population. The UN expects population growth to continue to gradually level off. Global population is almost sure to rise in the short term but the UN says there is a 1 in 4 chance that the world population will stabilize or fall before 2100.
